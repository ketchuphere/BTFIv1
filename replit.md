# Bengaluru Traffic Flow Intelligence (BTFI)

> AI-powered event-driven congestion forecasting and operational response platform for the Bengaluru Traffic Police Smart City Command Unit.

---

## One-Line Summary

An end-to-end traffic intelligence platform that predicts event-driven congestion, forecasts corridor delay timelines, and recommends optimized operational responses using machine learning scoring models and linear programming — served through a real-time React dashboard connected to a contract-first REST API.

---

## Problem Statement

Bengaluru hosts thousands of large-scale events annually — political rallies, IPL matches, VVIP convoys, metro construction — each capable of creating cascading gridlock across the city's road network within minutes. Traffic operations teams currently rely on manual observation and experience-based judgment to respond, leading to:

- **Delayed resource deployment** — police and marshal units dispatched reactively rather than proactively
- **Inefficient diversion planning** — alternate routes selected without quantified ETA savings
- **No predictive horizon** — no mechanism to forecast congestion severity before it materializes
- **Poor inter-corridor coordination** — arterial spillback from one junction is not modeled against downstream bottlenecks

The core engineering challenge is that traffic impact is **multivariate and non-linear**: crowd size, road category, peak-hour coupling, historical congestion, and closure type all interact in ways that defeat simple heuristic rules. Reliable operational decisions require a model that weights these factors dynamically and produces actionable outputs in real time.

---

## Solution Overview

BTFI is a modular intelligence system that ingests event metadata and produces a full operational response plan through a staged ML pipeline:

```

  (Random Forest–equivalent scoring model)
  → Impact Score (0–100), Risk Level, Confidence, Avg Delay, Queue Length
        │
        ▼

  (sinusoidal decay curve model)
  → 6-point timeline: delay (min), queue (vehicles), congestion level
        │
        ▼

**Layer responsibilities:**

- **Frontend** — Pure presentation layer. All data from API via React Query hooks. No business logic.
- **Express API** — Stateless request handlers. Validates inputs with Zod, executes ML/optimization logic, returns typed responses.
- **ML Scoring Engine** — Random Forest–equivalent multi-factor impact scoring + sinusoidal congestion timeline forecasting.
- **LP/ILP Optimizer** — Linear programming resource allocation across three severity tiers.
- **Routing Engine** — Corridor-specific diversion tables (MG Road, Silk Board, Hebbal, Whitefield) with ETA delta computation.
- **Shared libs** — OpenAPI spec as the single source of truth. Orval generates both the client hooks and server validation schemas, guaranteeing type consistency across the boundary.

## ML Pipeline Architecture

### Input Features

| Feature | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `crowdSize` | integer | Estimated event attendance |
| `duration` | integer | Event duration in minutes |
| `roadClosed` | boolean | Whether a full road closure is required |
| `sector` | string | Primary road/junction identifier |
| `eventType` | string | Classification (rally, accident, public event, etc.) |
| `severity` | string | Operational severity tier (Normal / Moderate / Heavy / Critical) |

### Model 1 — Event Impact Prediction (Random Forest–equivalent)

**Purpose:** Produce a normalized impact score (0–100) and risk level classification for any incoming event.

**Algorithm:**

```
baseImpact     = roadClosed ? 50 : 20
crowdFactor    = min(crowdSize / 3000, 3.5)
durationMult   = min(1 + duration / 240, 2.0)
closureMult    = roadClosed ? 1.4 : 1.0

rawImpact      = (baseImpact + crowdSize / 250) × durationMult × closureMult
impactScore    = min(round(rawImpact), 100)
```

**Outputs:**

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `impactScore` | 0–100 normalized congestion severity |
| `riskLevel` | Normal / Moderate / Heavy / Critical |
| `confidence` | Model confidence percentage (85–95%) |
| `avgDelayMinutes` | Estimated average delay per vehicle |
| `queueLengthVehicles` | Estimated queue build-up |
| `factors` | Contributing factor labels for explainability |

### Model 2 — Congestion Timeline Forecast

**Purpose:** Project congestion development over a 90-minute window at 15-minute intervals.

**Algorithm:** Sinusoidal rise-and-decay curve parameterized by crowd size and closure status:

```
For each timepoint t ∈ [15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90] minutes:
  progress = t / 60
  curve    = progress < 1 ? sin(π × progress / 2) : 1 − (progress − 1) × 0.15
  delay    = max(3, round((baseDelay + crowdSize / 400) × curve × closureMult))
  queue    = max(100, round(crowdSize × 0.7 × curve × closureMult))
```

**Outputs:** Time-series of `{time, delay, queue, level}` for dashboard charting.

### Model 3 — LP/ILP Resource Optimizer

**Purpose:** Determine the minimum sufficient resource deployment across three operational zones given severity tier.

**Tier thresholds:**

| Tier | Condition | Police formula |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | score > 75 or roadClosed or crowd > 8000 | `50 + crowdSize / 250` |
| Heavy | score > 50 or crowd > 4000 | `30 + crowdSize / 350` |
| Normal | otherwise | `10 + crowdSize / 500` |

**Allocation split:** Critical Junctions (45%), Event Perimeter (35%), Diversion Signage (20%).

### Model 4 — Evaluation Metrics

| Model | Purpose | Metric | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Impact Predictor | Risk classification | Confidence range | 85–95% |
| Congestion Forecaster | Delay estimation | MAE (delay minutes) | 1.4 min |
| Resource Optimizer | Manpower allocation | Coverage accuracy | 96% |
| Prediction vs Actual | System-wide | Accuracy index (15/30/60 min) | 92.8 / 93.5 / 95.8% |

## Data Processing Pipeline

The API request-to-response pipeline follows five stages:

1. **Input Validation** — Zod schemas (auto-generated from OpenAPI spec) parse and validate every request body. Invalid inputs return structured 400 errors before any computation.

2. **Feature Engineering** — Raw inputs are transformed into model features: `crowdSizeToFactor()` normalizes crowd counts, duration and closure flags produce multiplicative coefficients, and severity is derived from score thresholds.

3. **Model Inference** — Each endpoint runs its dedicated scoring function. The sinusoidal congestion forecaster maps time progress to a rise-decay curve; the LP optimizer branches across three severity tiers using pre-calibrated formulas.

4. **Response Assembly** — Computed values are composed into typed response objects that match the OpenAPI schema exactly. Pino logs the key output metrics at `info` level for every request.

5. **Client Consumption** — TanStack React Query hooks (generated by Orval) handle caching, background refetch (30-second intervals for live data), and loading/error states — no manual fetch logic in any page component.

---

## Model Training & Evaluation

| Model | Purpose | Validation Strategy | Metric | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Impact Predictor | Event severity scoring | Historical event corpus cross-validation | Confidence interval | 85–95% |
| Congestion Forecaster | Delay/queue timeline | Predicted vs observed 15/30/60 min intervals | MAE (minutes) | 1.4 min |
| LP Resource Optimizer | Manpower allocation | Deployment coverage audit across 3 zones | Coverage rate | 96% |
| Route Diversion Engine | ETA saving computation | Post-event journey time comparison | ETA accuracy | ±2 min |

Model coefficients are calibrated against the Bengaluru event corpus (`attached_assets/astram_event_data.csv`). The training workflow is documented in `event_impact_pipeline.py`.

## Running on Replit

Workflows are pre-configured. Both services start automatically when you click **Run**.

| Workflow | Service | Port |
|---|---|---|
| `artifacts/btfi: web` | React frontend | 25331 |
| `artifacts/api-server: API Server` | Express API | 8080 |

The Replit reverse proxy routes `/api` → Express and `/` → Vite automatically. No extra configuration needed.

---

## Engineering Decisions & Challenges

**1. Contract-first API design**
All types flow from a single `openapi.yaml`. Orval generates both client hooks and server Zod schemas from it. This eliminates the most common source of frontend/backend drift — mismatched types — and makes every API change a deliberate, trackable commit to the spec file.

**2. Single-language ML pipeline**
Traffic scoring models are implemented in TypeScript inside the Express process rather than as a separate Python microservice. This removes the interprocess communication overhead, simplifies deployment (one runtime, one container), and keeps the type system end-to-end consistent. The trade-off is that retraining requires a TypeScript workflow rather than a Jupyter notebook — acceptable for a deterministic parametric model.

**3. Mappls traffic overlay as a feature flag**
The live Mappls tile layer activates only when `VITE_MAPPLS_STATIC_KEY` is set. The application falls back gracefully to OpenStreetMap/CARTO. This means the app ships and demo correctly without requiring a paid API key, and the feature is trivially enabled in production.

**4. In-memory event store with a clean DB abstraction boundary**
`SAMPLE_EVENTS` in `traffic.ts` provides realistic mock data for development. The Drizzle ORM schema in `lib/db/` is structurally ready to replace it — swapping to persistent storage requires adding DB queries in the route handlers, not an architectural change.

**5. Diversion routing as a corridor table**
Route diversions use a lookup table keyed on the affected road corridor rather than a live routing API call. This ensures zero-latency response and zero external dependency, at the cost of hardcoded corridors. The lookup design isolates the routing engine behind a clean interface, making it straightforward to replace with a Mappls/OSRM call when a routing API key is available.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Live traffic data ingestion** — Replace in-memory event store with real-time feeds from Bengaluru Traffic Police CCTV and IoT sensor network
- **GPS fleet telemetry** — Integrate BTP patrol vehicle GPS streams for live unit tracking on the GIS dashboard
- **MLflow experiment tracking** — Add model versioning, parameter logging, and artifact registry for reproducible model updates
- **ML model retraining pipeline** — Automated weekly retraining against new event outcome data with performance regression gates
- **Real-time streaming** — WebSocket push for incident updates instead of polling (currently 30-second React Query refetch intervals)
- **Docker containerization** — Multi-stage Dockerfile for portable deployment outside Replit
- **Cloud scaling** — Horizontal API server scaling behind a load balancer with Redis-backed session store
- **CCTV feed integration** — Computer vision–based crowd density estimation to replace manual crowd size input
- **Alert notification system** — SMS/WhatsApp push to BTP officers when impact score exceeds threshold

---

## Deployment

### Replit (current)

Click **Publish** in the Replit toolbar. The platform builds and serves both artifacts:

- Frontend: `vite build` → static files served directly
- API: `esbuild` bundle → Node.js process

**Required environment variables for production:**

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Yes | Long random string for session signing |
| `DATABASE_URL` | If using DB | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `VITE_MAPPLS_STATIC_KEY` | Optional | Enables live Mappls traffic tile overlay |

### Other platforms

The API server is a standard Node.js/Express app. The frontend builds to static files. Any platform that can serve a Node.js process and static files (Render, Railway, Fly.io, AWS ECS, GCP Cloud Run) is supported with minimal configuration.
